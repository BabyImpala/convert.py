# convert.py

A pyhton script to be used alongside @Scrabx3's [SexLab-Scene-Builder](https://github.com/Scrabx3/SexLab-Scene-Builder) to expediate bulk conversion of SLAL animation packs to SLSB format, ensuring extended compatibility with Scrab's [SexlabPPlus 2.0+](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/25318-sexlab-p/).

Originally drafted and maintained by @ponzipyramid with parser updates from @MissCorruption (see commit history [here](https://github.com/Scrabx3/SexLab-Scene-Builder/commits/master/scripts/convert.py)), the development of the script has mostly been done by me on [Scrab's Dicord](https://discord.gg/JPSHb4ebqj), allowing me to update my `Automated SLSB Conversions`.

To get started with the conversion process, read the follwing guide: [slal_to_slsb_guide](https://github.com/BabyImpala/convert.py/blob/main/slal_to_slsb_guide.md).
